# Changelog

All notable changes to the OwlLog project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.5] 

### Added
- **Live Activity integration** — Added `OwlActivityKitSession` and `OwlActivityKitLifecycleDelegate` to drive a Live Activity (iOS 16.1+) that mirrors network log updates.
- **SwiftUI lifecycle guidance** — Documented recommended integration patterns in `README.md` for foreground/background handling.
- **Hidden overlay mode** — Added `OwlOverlay(isActive:)` so you can hide the floating button while keeping the inspector sheet modifier active.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Now captures and displays stack traces and specific error codes for failed requests.
- **Network Error Classification**: Automatically categorizes errors (e.g., Offline, Timeout, DNS Failure) for easier diagnosis.
- **Console Logging**: Enhanced logging output with clear error reasons and status indicators.
- **UI Improvements**: Better text selection in error views and visual indication of error codes in the log list.
- **Status Handling**: Improved handling of missing status codes and readable HTTP status display.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-12

### Fix
- Fixed an issue where `OwlHTTPCall` could contain duplicated IDs, causing inconsistencies in the HTTP call list.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-12

### Added
